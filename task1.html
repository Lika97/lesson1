<b> In April 2011, Larry Harvey announced that the LLC was beginning a three-year process to transfer ownership and control of the event over to a new non-profit organization called the "Burning Man Project." </b>
<i>The move towards becoming a non-profit organization was the result of "bitter infighting" between members of the board.</i>
<u>At one point it looked like all of the board members were going to hire lawyers.</u>
<s>Corporate appraisers were brought in to determine how much the company was worth, which Larry Harvey found "abhorrent" and against all of the values that Burning Man stood for. </s>

An earlier agreement stated that each member of the LLC would only receive sole compensation for many years of service, a golden parachute of $20,000.

 But the members now consented to an arrangement whereby each member of the LLC would receive an undisclosed sum prior to the transfer of their ownership rights to the Burning Man Project. Marian Goodell, board member and head of communications, addressed concerns about the lack of transparency with this statement.
